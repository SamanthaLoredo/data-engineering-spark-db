    "## Impact of Constraints on DML\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand the impact of constraints on DML Operations such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.\n",
    "* RDBMS Databases are nothing but softwares which are developed by Software Engineers like us.\n",
    "* Database Commands or Statements are user friendly way of dealing with objects such as tables, indexes as well as data in those objects.\n",
    "* Here are some of the details about what happens when we issue Database Commands or Statements in general.\n",
    "  * Compile the Database Command or Statement into low level code(Syntax Checks and Semantec Checks).\n",
    "  * Execute the low level code. Execution typically involves quite a lot of internal validations based on the command issues.\n",
    "* Now let us understand what all internal validations are done when we perform DML operation on a table such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.\n",
    "  * Data Type checks and checks for length\n",
    "  * Constraint Checks (`NOT NULL`, `CHECK`, `UNIQUE`, etc)\n",
    "* If any of the constraints fail, then the exceptions will be raised.\n",
    "* To enforce `UNIQUE` constraints, data in the database tables is supposed to be processed on each and every operation at record level.\n",
    "* On top of validations, when the DML Statements or Commands are executed it will take care of assigning default values, sequence generated numbers, etc if they are applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Due to the validations, there will be overhead when DML Operations are performed.\n"
